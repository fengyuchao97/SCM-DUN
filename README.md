# SCMamba for CASSI

This repo is the implementation of paper "2D-Slice and 3D-Cube Mamba Network for Snapshot Spectral Compressive Imaging"

# Abstract

Hyperspectral image (HSI) reconstruction algorithms are fundamental to coded aperture snapshot spectral imaging (CASSI) systems. Recently, deep unfolding networks (DUNs) have emerged as a dominant solution, seamlessly combining traditional optimization frameworks with the strengths of deep learning. Among these, Mamba stands out as a prominent method for modeling long-range dependencies. However, its reliance on one-dimensional (1D) spatial scanning often compromises spectral consistency and spatial coherence, leading to misalignment of neighboring pixels within sequences. To address these limitations, we propose a novel multi-view framework based on 2D-slice modeling, which ensures spatial-spectral continuity in 1D sequences while maintaining computational efficiency. Furthermore, motivated by the need for precise local patch modeling in 2D images, we develop a 3D-cube Mamba model for HSI reconstruction. By integrating the UNet architecture, this model enhances spatial and spectral detail representation through multi-scale receptive field modeling, using fixed cube sizes to dynamically adjust pixel distances. These advancements are incorporated into the A-HQS-accelerated deep unfolding framework, synergistically combining the strengths of 2D-slice and 3D-cube MambaNet to achieve state-of-the-art HSI reconstruction performance. Experimental evaluations on simulated and real-world CASSI datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach, achieving superior spectral fidelity and detailed feature representation.

We use the CAVE dataset (cave_1024_28) as the simulation training set. Both the CAVE (cave_1024_28) and KAIST (KAIST_CVPR2021) datasets are used as the real training set.
